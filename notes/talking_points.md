# Canister side

- Short term - Adopt the ic-stable-structures to leverage stable memory for data storage. Should tentatively reduce our costs in half essentially cutting upgrade cost to near zero
- Short term - Implement a active canister reclamation solution that reclaims fleet canisters from idle users who've abandoned their accounts and reuses them for new signups. Archive existing users data to a archival solution and restore to a new canister on future activation. Should also significantly reduce costs, letting us reclaim 40-70% of our approximate fleet on a regular basis.
- Long term - Invest in running nodes and become node providers essentially being able to pay for cycles with IC earned, in a way hosting our app on our own hardware, IC providing the software stack
- Long term - Stake significant portions of the SNS DAO treasury into neurons and using the maturity from those neurons to pay for cycles.

# REDUCED CYCLE COSTS

- Sustained use discounts
- Subnet rentals with lower cycle costs per the entire subnet
